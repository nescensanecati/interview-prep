# Scope Description
In today's highly competitive job market, technical interviews play a crucial role in determining the success of candidates seeking roles in the technology industry. Technical interviews assess a candidate's ability to solve complex problems, apply theoretical knowledge, and showcase their practical skills. However, many individuals face significant challenges during technical interviews, leading to missed opportunities and feelings of inadequacy.

We propose the development of a comprehensive online platform dedicated to addressing the challenges faced by individuals preparing for technical interviews. This platform will offer an integrated and adaptable learning experience.
