      {"1. Resume Screening:": "The process often begins with a resume or application review. Recruiters or hiring managers will assess your qualifications, work experience, and educational background to determine if you meet the basic requirements for the position."},
      {"2. Phone Screen:": "If your resume passes the initial screening, you may have a phone screen with a recruiter or HR representative. This is typically a brief conversation to discuss your background, interests, and to answer any initial questions you may have about the company or the role."},      
      {"3. Technical Phone Interview:": "After the initial phone screen, you may have one or more technical phone interviews. These interviews typically focus on assessing your coding skills, data structures, and algorithms knowledge. You might be asked to solve coding challenges on a shared online coding platform or discuss technical problems over the phone."},
      {"4. On-Site or Virtual Interviews:": "Depending on the company and the current state of remote work, this step could either be an on-site interview at the company's office or a series of virtual interviews. During these interviews, you'll meet with multiple engineers or technical team members to discuss technical topics in-depth, solve coding problems on a whiteboard or computer, and possibly participate in system design discussions. These interviews may include behavioral questions to assess your interpersonal and communication skills."},
      {"5. Coding and Technical Challenges:": "You might be given coding challenges or take-home assignments to complete before or after the technical interviews. These challenges assess your problem-solving skills, coding proficiency, and your ability to work independently."},
      {"6. System Design Interview: ": "For more senior roles or positions requiring a strong architectural understanding, you may have a system design interview. In this interview, you'll be asked to design a system or component, discuss trade-offs, scalability, and other relevant considerations."},
      {"7. Behavioral Interviews: ": "Behavioral interviews assess your soft skills, teamwork, and cultural fit. You may be asked about your past experiences, how you handle challenges, and how you work with others. It's important to provide concrete examples from your work history to demonstrate your skills and experiences."},
      {"8. Coding Assessments and Whiteboard Interviews:": "Some companies still use whiteboard or coding assessments during on-site interviews. You'll be asked to solve coding problems on a whiteboard or in an online coding platform. These interviews test your ability to think on your feet and write clean, efficient code."},
      {"9. Final Interview(s):": "Depending on the company, you may have a final round of interviews with senior leadership or executives to assess your overall fit with the organization's goals and values."},
      {"10. Offer:": "If you pass all interview rounds successfully, you'll receive an offer from the company. This offer will include details about compensation, benefits, and other relevant terms of employment."},
      {"11. Negotiation:": "You may have the opportunity to negotiate the offer, including salary, benefits, and other aspects of the job."},
      {"12. Acceptance:": "Once negotiations are complete and both parties are satisfied, you can formally accept the offer and begin the onboarding process."}
